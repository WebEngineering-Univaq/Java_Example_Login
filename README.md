# Java_Example_Login
> Detailed login/logout process and session safety management with Java servlets

This example shows how to use sessions to authenticate the user through the common login/logout procedures. We also show some basic session protection techniques.

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 11th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse. 

*Please do not download the code from the main branch, but from the branch corresponding to the platform used in the lectures:**
- the **JEE** branch contains the application version to be run on the **JavaEE 8** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 9**. 
- the **JKEE** branch contains the application version to be run on the **JakartaEE 10** platform inside **Apache Tomcat version 10**. 

Note that you may need to *configure the deploy settings* based on the chosen platform/server: refer to your IDE help files to perform this step. For example, in Apache Netbeans, you must enter these settings in Project properties > Run.
