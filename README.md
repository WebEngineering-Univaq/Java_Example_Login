# Java_Example_Login
> Detailed login/logout process and session safety management with Java servlets

This example shows how to use sessions to authenticate the user through the common login/logout procedures. We also show some basic session protection techniques.

## Usage

This is a *sample application* developed during the lectures of the  [**Web Engineering course**](https://webengineering-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 11th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*

## Installation

This is a Maven-based project. Simply download the code and open it in any Maven-enabled IDE such as Netbeans or Eclipse. 

The main branch contains the application version to be run on the **JakartaEE 10** platform inside the **Apache Tomcat 11** server. 
Note that you may need to *configure the project deploy settings* in your IDE based on the chosen platform/server: refer to the IDE help files to perform this step. For example, in Apache Netbeans, you must enter these settings in Project properties > Run.

The **JEE** branch contains the old application version designed to run on the **JavaEE 8** platform inside **Apache Tomcat 9**, and is no longer maintained or updated.
